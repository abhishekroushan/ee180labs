# ee180labs
Labs in EE180 Digital system architecture course

Mergesort algorithm implemented in .s file

Github instructions:
1. Go to the directory where you want to implement the codes in the lab:

cd <directory_path>

2. Clone the repository: (get the url from the 'Clone or Download' green button on the page):

git clone <url>

3. All the files are present in the current directory. Now make changes in the file and save them.

4. Add the files which you have changed to git:

git add <file_name>

4. Commit the changes with comments after -m:

git commit -m "Comments to add"

5. Push the changes to the repository:

git push origin master

6. If the push is not working, it implies that you don't have the latest copy of codes in your system, thus pull is required:

git fetch -p

git pull origin master

Now try step 5.

7 While pushing, the git may ask for your username and password which you have to provide once you have set up your github 
account in the github website: https://github.com
